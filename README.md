# Ill-make-a-man-out-of-you.
This is part of the lyrics from a popular song that comes from Mulan. The song is called Ill make a man out of you by Danny Osmond.

Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win

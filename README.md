# Ill-make-a-man-out-of-you.
This is part of the lyrics from a popular song that comes from Mulan. The song is called Ill make a man out of you by Danny Osmond.

Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you
Tranquil as a forest
But on fire within
Once you find your center
You are sure to win

# I'll be there (by walk off the Earth)
When the tears are rolling down
like a river to the ocean
when there's no one else around
you won't question my devoltion
everybody needs somebody
and you got me
you know that i know that you that 
i'll be there for the highs and the lows 
give you mine when your heart gets broke
by your side, when you're all alone
I'll be there
when you're down, da-down on your luck
No ride home and you got too drunk
Two A.M. I'mma pick you up
I will be there, ay
